* Dropbox Utilities
Wraps around dropbox API and provides functionality for reading and writing 
various types of files

** Readers
All readers follow the following algorithm: 
- Convert dropbox path into a link. A maximum number of attempts 
  are made to generate the link. After those fail, an exception is raised
- Read the link into a in-memory buffer, a BytesIO instance
- Use your custom reader, to read from bytes io instance
The current set readers provide functionality for reading the following types of
files: 
- CSV files into pandas dataframes
- Excel files into pandas dataframes
- Config/INI files into Configparser instance

** Writers

- Write the data to buffer this could be either StringIO or bytesIO
- Convert this buffer to bytes. In case of string, encode it with propery encoding ('UTF-8')
- Use the dropbox library to upload to the appropriate location
